# LightGBM

In machine learning, the LightGBM classifier is part of the Boosting family, and today it is the most common classification model in the machine learning community. 
LightGBM is a powerful machine learning model that can be shaped depending on the task you are working on.

Letâ€™s say if you are working on the regression problem you have to use the LightGBM Regressor model, 
and if you are working on a classification problem you have to use the LightGBM Classifier model.

In general, it supports the following applications:

classification
regression
binary classification
multi-classification
cross-entropy
